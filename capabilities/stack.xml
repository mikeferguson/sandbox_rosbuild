  <description brief="Tools for tracking the capabilties provided by launch files.">
    This stack contains a capabilities server, and a capabilities-aware launch tool
    built on top of roslaunch. By creating a .capabilities file for each launch file
    you can specify both the capabilities offered by this file (which is indexed by the
    server) and those capabilities required by the launch file itself.
